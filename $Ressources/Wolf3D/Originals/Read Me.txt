These are the original MIDI files created by Bobby Prince for the game 
Wolfenstein 3D. They were downloaded from his Web page, but are no longer 
available.

When they were converted to IMF format to be played as FM synthesis for the 
game there was a noticeable loss of quality. This is how the songs were 
originally intended to sound.
